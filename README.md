# EasyCal
This is a very simple app which aims to provide a seamless calculative experience to the user.

Tentative Key Feature:
* Doing basic computation
* Maintaining previous computed result and doing future operations on it
* Way to see the history of operations
* Fall back option given to user to correct the input

Use Cases:
* Hassle free oprations if someone has to do a similar operation on a large set. E.g: Sometimes shopkeepers tend to use their calculators to add a list of prices.
* Very often while computing things you need a way to compute results in a serialized way and you are too lazy to write a big expression on the calculator, so instead you just want to give the series of operations.
